## Output Library for Arduino - ezOutput
This library is designed for digitial output pin to set it to HIGH, LOW, TOGGLE, BLINK_WITHOUT_DELAY. It is easy to use with multiple output pins to control multiple LED, relay... It is designed for not only beginners but also experienced users.

**ezOutput** stands for **easy output**, which mean that the library is easy to use.
